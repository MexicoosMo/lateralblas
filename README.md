## How does it work

trace.moe uses [sola](https://github.com/soruly/sola) to index video and work with liresolr. This repo only include the webapp for trace.moe, which demonstrate how to integrate anilist info, and how thumbnail/video previews are generated. If you want to make your own video scene search engine, please refer to sola instead.

## Integrating search with trace.moe
To add trace.moe as a search option for your site, pass the image URL via query string like this
```
https://trace.moe/?url=http://searchimageurl
```

You can also specify playback options like this
```
https://trace.moe/?autoplay=0&loop&mute=1&url=http://searchimageurl
```

Playback URL params:

| param    | value  | default (not set in URL param) | set with empty or other value |
|----------|--------|---|---|
| autoplay | 0 or 1 | 1 | 1 |
| mute     | 0 or 1 | 0 | 1 |
| loop     | 0 or 1 | 0 | 1 |

The `auto` URL parameter is no longer used, it would always search automatically when there is `?url=` param.

Note that the server cannot access private image URLs.
In that case, users has to copy and paste (Ctrl+V/Cmd+V) the image directly, or save and upload the file.
