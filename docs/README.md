## Search

POST as FORM

```bash
curl -X POST https://trace.moe/api/search -d "image=$(base64 -w 0 your_search_image.jpg)"
```

POST as JSON

```bash
curl -X POST https://trace.moe/api/search -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{ "image" : "'$(base64 -w 0 your_search_image.jpg)'" }'
```

| Fields | Value             | Notes                                |
| ------ | ----------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| image  | String (Required) | Base64 Encoded Image                 |
| filter | Number (Optional) | Limit search to specific anilist ID. |

### Search Image Format

- Supported image format is any format supported by `javax.imageio.ImageIO` (i.e. jpg, png, bmp, gif)
- For Animated GIF, only first frame is used for searching
- [Data URI](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Basics_of_HTTP/Data_URIs) prefix like `data:image/jpeg;base64,` is optional. Only data part after the comma is used. This is to maintain compatibility with [toDataURL()](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLCanvasElement/toDataURL) with HTML5 canvas.
- Binary file upload is not yet supported

<Note type="warning">

Note that there is a hard limit of 1MB post size. You should ensure your Base64 encoded image is < 1MB. Otherwise the server responds with HTTP 413 (Request Entity Too Large).

</Note>

Javascript Example

```javascript
var img = document.querySelector("img"); // select image from DOM
var canvas = document.createElement("canvas");
canvas.width = img.naturalWidth;
canvas.height = img.naturalHeight;
var ctx = canvas.getContext("2d");
ctx.drawImage(img, 0, 0, canvas.width, canvas.height);

fetch("https://trace.moe/api/search", {
  method: "POST",
  body: JSON.stringify({ image: canvas.toDataURL("image/jpeg", 0.8) }),
  headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" }
})
  .then(res => res.json())
  .then(result => {
    console.log(result);
  });
```

<Note type="tip">

Search results with similarity lower than 87% are probably incorrect result (just similar, not a match). It's up to you to decide the cut-off value.

</Note>

### Search Result Notes

- Results are always sorted by similarity, from most similar to least similar
- If multiple results are found in the same file, near the same timecode and has similarity > 98%, results are grouped as one, using `from` and `to` to indicate the starting time and ending time of that scene.
- `episode` is only an estimated number extraction from `filename`, it may fail and return empty string
- With `anilist_id`, you may get more anime info from `https://anilist.co/anime/{anilist_id}` . Read [AniList API](https://github.com/AniList/ApiV2-GraphQL-Docs) for more information.
- The list of chinese translation can be obtained from [anilist-chinese](https://github.com/soruly/anilist-chinese)
- API would return HTTP 400 if your search image is empty
- API would return HTTP 403 if are using an invalid token
- API would return HTTP 429 if are using requesting too fast
- API would return HTTP 500 or HTTP 503 if something went wrong in backend

If your image is malformed, you may got an error message (HTTP 500) like this:

```
"Error reading image from URL: http://192.168.2.11/pic/1549186015.8901.jpg: http://192.168.2.11/pic/1549186015.8901.jpg"
```

These image URLs are for debugging use, and is not accessible from internet. You may send this to admin to inspect what went wrong. All images send to server are deleted after 24 hours.

Aside from the JSON response or the [/me](#Me) endpoint, you can also get the current limit from HTTP response header.

```
x-whatanime-limit: 9
x-whatanime-limit-ttl: 60
x-whatanime-quota: 148
x-whatanime-quota-ttl: 85899
```

Once the limit is reached. Server would respond HTTP 429 Too Many Requests, with a double quoted string showing when the quota will reset.

Example

```
"Search limit exceeded. Please wait 87 seconds."
```

<Note type="tip">

All error messages are double quoted string in order to ensure they are always valid JSON format.

</Note>

## Previews

With `tokenthumb` you obtained from [/search](#Search), you can get previews of the matched scene. (not 100% accurate due to timecode and seeking method)

### Image Preview

```
https://trace.moe/thumbnail.php?anilist_id=${anilist_id}&file=${encodeURIComponent(filename)}&t=${at}&token=${tokenthumb}
```

### Video Preview

There is a 3 second video preview of the matched scene. (1 seconds before and 2 seconds ahead)

```
https://trace.moe/preview.php?anilist_id=${anilist_id}&file=${encodeURIComponent(filename)}&t=${at}&token=${tokenthumb}
```

### Video Preview with Natural Scene Cutting

With [trace.moe-media](https://github.com/soruly/trace.moe-media), it can now detect timestamp boundaries of a scene naturally.

```
https://media.trace.moe/video/${anilist_id}/${encodeURIComponent(filename)}?t=${at}&token=${tokenthumb}`
```

Or, if you prefer getting a mute video:

```
https://media.trace.moe/video/${anilist_id}/${encodeURIComponent(filename)}?t=${at}&token=${tokenthumb}&mute`
```

## Me

Let you check the search quota and limit for your account (or IP address).

```bash
curl https://trace.moe/api/me
```

## Rate limit and Search Quota

You can use the API with / without an API token. The difference is the limit when you access the `/api/search` endpoint.

When no API token is given, the system limit search by IP address, and count both search via API and webpage together.

|              | via Webpage / via API without token | Registered Developers | Patreons      |
| ------------ | ----------------------------------- | --------------------- | ------------- |
| Rate Limit   | 10/minute                           | 10/minute             | 10-30/minute  |
| Search quota | 150/day[^1]                         | 1000/day[^2]          | 1000-3000/day |

If you need more search quota, send me email (soruly@gmail.com) to become registered developers.

- [^1]: This quota is proportional to the Successful Pledges on [patreon](https://www.patreon.com/soruly)
- [^2]: This quota is proportional to API limit without token

To request with token, just add `token=your_api_token` to the URL param.  
e.g. `https://trace.moe/api/me?token=your_api_token`
